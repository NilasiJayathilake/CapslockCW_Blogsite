# Capslock Content Writing BlogSite
This is a blogsite that I created for "Capslock Content Writing". It works as a site for Capslock Content Writing to showcase their samples for potential customers. This is my very first, own full stack project I created. Though traditional it helped me grap the basics of the MERN stack and get started on other projects.
